Any changes related to attributes, spatial relations, counting, or any alterations unrelated to objects are strictly forbidden.\nThe new object should be visually distinct and mutually exclusive from the original, ensuring the replacement object look different than the original. Ensure the objects being swapped are not synonymous or closely related sub-categories, to prevent identical edits.\nThe edit should be limited to one region, not requiring adjustments elsewhere in the image for scene consistency.\nAdhere to a one-to-one replacement rule; introduce no additional objects beyond the one being replaced.\nReject the edit if it introduces unnecessary specificity by making implicit assumptions about the object in the original unless it's explicitly clear from the original caption.\nReject the edit if the information provided is insufficient or uncertain. The filtering process is strict; when in doubt, it's better to reject the edit.\nAn acceptable edit must adhere to all the criteria.\nFirst, provide a concise explanation of your understanding of the proposed edit.

    "task_instruction": "Your task is to evaluate the proposed edit of a region in a given image caption. The edit can occur in the object, attribute, or action. Respond with 'YES' if the edit corresponds only to a region and changes one of the categories, or 'NO' if it doesn't. Please provide a brief reason for your decision. Follow these guidelines: For object changes, avoid synonyms or changes to an object that is not distinct enough. For attribute changes, ensure that only the attribute (e.g., color, pattern, condition) differs, while the object remains the same. For action changes, the action should be distinct and visibly different in the edited image. Reject the edit if the information is insufficient or you are uncertain. The filtering process is strict, so when in doubt, it's better to reject the edit. Refer to the examples provided for further clarification.",
